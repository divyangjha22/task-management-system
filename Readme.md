# Task Management System

## Overview

The Task Management System is a robust Python application designed to demonstrate practical usage of various data structures in a modular, production-like environment. This project showcases how fundamental Python data structures can be combined to efficiently manage tasks, users, and their interdependencies.

## Key Features

### Task Storage
- **Implementation:** Tasks are stored in a Python list.
- **Benefit:** Provides a simple, ordered collection for managing and iterating over tasks.

### User Management
- **Implementation:** Users are maintained in a dictionary.
- **Benefit:** Enables quick lookups and efficient management by mapping unique user IDs to user details.

### Task Assignments
- **Implementation:** Utilizes a queue for managing task assignments.
- **Benefit:** Ensures tasks are handled in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner, maintaining order and predictability in task processing.

### Task History Tracking
- **Implementation:** Employs a stack to track completed tasks.
- **Benefit:** Allows easy access to the most recent tasks completed, facilitating an intuitive backtracking of task progress.

### Task Dependencies
- **Implementation:** Integrates a graph to manage complex task dependencies.
- **Benefit:** Helps visualize and control task sequences, ensuring prerequisite tasks are completed before subsequent ones are initiated.

## Conclusion

This project serves as an excellent example of leveraging Python's built-in data structures to create an efficient and scalable task management system. Whether you're looking to deepen your understanding of lists, dictionaries, queues, stacks, or graphs, this application provides practical insights into their real-world applications.
